# Description

A .Net version of Niek's LispIDE (www.daansystems.com) with added features.
This project uses ScintillaNet and Weifen Luo's DockPanel Suite.

This project was created for my AI class at UCLA. I was frustrated with available editors and wanted something that was simple yet fully functional.

I'll be adding several functionality improvements with time and as they are requested. If you'd like to contribute to this project in any way, please let me know.

This project was originally designed to work with GCL. If you encounter problems with other Lisp REPLs, please let me know.

A major update I'll be working on once I have more free time, includes porting this application to Mono. However, this means that I must also port ScintillaNet and DockPanel Suite to Mono and GTK#. I will most likely need help porting these projects, so please let me know if you'd like to help.

I'll update this page with more information and documentation once I have some free time.

**Note**: For single instance functionality, I'm using a modified version of [Shy Agam's SingleInstancingIpc](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/SingleInstancingWithIpc.aspx) that uses .Net 3.5 NamedPipes.
